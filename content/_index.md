### About

{{< figure src="/images/me.png" alt="Black and white stylized profile picture of Prodromos Kolyvakis" class="fig-center" >}}

I am an ardent Senior Machine Learning Researcher with
extensive experience. My academic endeavors, crowned with a [Ph.D. from EPFL](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/277801)
focusing on *NLP*, place me at the vanguard
of applying intricate machine learning research to real-world, multi-industry
challenges. My professional canvas paints across [academia](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JfdNPDkAAAAJ&hl=en), [smart home tech](https://alexa.amazon.com),
[fintech](https://www.ai2c.ch), [healthcare](https://www.chuv.ch/en/bdsc/research/our-groups/clinical-data-science), and [virtual reality](https://oramavr.com/), illustrating a history of pioneering solutions.

Driven by the zest to conquer formidable challenges, I propel tech boundaries,
crafting smarter, efficient systems. Beyond innovation, my zeal for *AI's role
in social good* steers my skills towards humanitarian efforts for a hopeful,
inclusive tomorrow.
